          Harpy Hal sat alone on the dusty floor of his empty tree trunk,
          looking out the window hole he had made with his beak and claws over
          many years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside he saw many things – birds singing (Whitney was calling to her
          new interest Danny, eager to flirt), chipmunks jumping (Das and Jonah
          had recently become close friends), snails marching (oh how patient
          they were). Passing clouds took turns obscuring some of the light,
          leaving a small beam to illuminate each scene for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet despite the movement outside, the life buzzing around him, the
          joy and the passing light, he felt stuck. Unable to move beyond the
          home he made in this oak tree. He remembers the day he found it –
          soaring above, the glittering leaves called to him like a gentle
          neighbor. That day felt far away now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rotating his head to the left, he saw the portrait of his mother the
          groundhog had made for him (at half price, he still didn’t understand
          why). How he missed her. Once over a slow sunset dinner of mice and,
          she told him that the greatest affliction of this life was to feel
          like you don’t belong. “My whole life,” she said, “I felt like an
          outcast.” Why weren’t there other birds who could look in every
          direction? (This made her feel like a freak.) Why must she prey on
          mammals instead of insects? (This made her feel like a murderer.) Why
          did she enjoy the night? (She missed out on daytime activities and
          friendships.) “And only now as I reach the end, do I see what a waste
          it was to feel like there was something wrong with me.” She gave her
          head a full 360 degree shake, and with a soft smile moved closer to
          her son on the cold night.
        </p>
        <p>
          How he longed for her wisdom and comfort. Since she passed, he’d felt
          lost. They did so much together and now, who was his companion? With
          whom did he doubt, dine, dip and dive; stay up into the early hours of
          the morning? Who made each moment feel like a journey instead of a
          slog? Hunting felt like a chore that even stomach pangs didn’t
          encourage, and he’d lost considerable strength and weight. He often
          slept through both day and night, which no one noticed because they
          never saw him anyways. Meeting other owls was hard (where does one
          go?), and he often managed to put his foot in his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>“Excuse me, miss, I think you dropped a feather.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, thank you, how kind.”</p>
        <p>
          “Ah, wait, looking at it now I think that was mine. Can I... have it
          back?”
        </p>
        <p>
          His whole home, really, was filled with memories of her. The first
          nest she built, that he was born in. Skeletons they kept because they
          were especially beautiful. The wall covered with tiny marks where
          they’d pretended to be woodpeckers and, failing miserably, nursed
          their sore beaks for days. He couldn’t bear it – he felt like the
          world somehow went on, found meaning and joy and love, but his had
          stopped and wouldn’t turn again, it just couldn’t turn again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day was almost over, and the world began to fade. Hal moved from
          the floor to the door. Danny had called to Whitney and they were by
          the pond (now definitely flirting), Das and Jonah started to make a
          fort which they would continue tomorrow (as young chipmunks, they were
          due home), and the snails had moved a few more inches (and it was
          enough). It was strange; he felt a glimmer of joy for these creatures,
          and yet so remote and therefore jealous of their experiences that the
          light quickly extinguished, leaving him in a smoky gloom.
        </p>
        <p>
          What did his mother say about death? Ah yes, “Your body falls to the
          ground, and your spirit rises to the sky.”
        </p>
        <p>
          He lifted his head, pushed with his feet and wings so that he was
          airborne. He flew high, high into the air. He kept going, past where
          he knew it was safe, past where he knew owls or birds or creatures
          belonged, thinking, “but maybe this is where I belong,” and as he kept
          climbing he gasped for air, breathing its thinness, breathing its
          waning life, yes this must be it, I’m coming for you mama until a
          great whiteness wrapped its wings around him, carrying him the rest of
          the way, until he didn’t need to be.
