        “Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and try to love
        the questions themselves, like locked rooms and like books that are now
        written in a very foreign tongue. Do not now seek the answers, which
        cannot be given you because you would not be able to live them. And the
        point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will
        then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into
        the answer.” ― Rainer Maria Rilke
