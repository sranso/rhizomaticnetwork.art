```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start

- what is the message here. how can i make this more silly.
- look at notion notes, at alan watts
- add time, am/pm to local storage
- stop making sense, add more nonsense. things don't need to make sense! but if they don't, they should have more delight. where there is less sense, there is more delight, so the value remains consistent.
